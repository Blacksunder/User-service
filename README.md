# User-service
Console Java application with basic CRUD operations using Hibernate. It provides the console interface and functions for getting, updating, saving and removing users from/to the database.

Before the first launch you should go to User-service/src/main/resources and configure hibernate.cfg.xml (database connection settings).

If added configurations are correct, you can launch this application using launch.sh script (for Unix systems) or by openning User-service package with IDE and running Main.java.
